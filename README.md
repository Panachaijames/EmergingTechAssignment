# EmergingTechAssignment
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

An overview of the scikit-learn Python library and a demonstration of three scikit-learn algorithms
An overview of Deutsch's algorithm and a comparision of quantum computing vs classical computing
***
## Quick Steps
You can view the scikit-learn notebook by clicking the following image:

Viewing with binder is unavailible as it just show requirement.txt on there and have no idea how it happen.
